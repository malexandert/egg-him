# egg-him

when you read the server.js you'll realize that the total egg count is not accurate. I am using heroku to host this and realized that everytime the dynos restart the count would go back to zero. so i update the code the ugly way to made sure the count goes to a closer number to the actual count than 0. of course this is not practical since i will not be checking and updating that number (total_eggs) all the time.

I started implementing a database using MongoDB and Mongoose but then i kinda got bored and moved on to other projects. so before you do anything else that's a thing that needs fixing.

also i apologize if the code is messy or is this README is slightly incomprehensible.

also am willing to share hosting & url just hmu :)
